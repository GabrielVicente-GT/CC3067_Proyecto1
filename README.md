The developed project consists of a client that communicates with the XMPP protocol to the "alumchat.xyz" domain in such a way that it allows communication between different accounts as well as their manipulation.

## Project features

It consists of a simple project, in such a way that the SMACK library is used, a java library that allows manipulating XMPP stanzas and thus being able to develop all the functionalities described below. To execute it, it is necessary to take into account the context in which it was developed and using a OS Windows.
The tools that were used were: 
- Visual Studio Code
- Maven
- Junit
- Java

It is necessary that these tools and programming languages ​​are well configured in an environment so that when you want to clone this repository there is no problem when trying to run it

## Functionalities Implemented

This client that uses XMPP has the following characteristics:
#### Account management
1) Register a new account on the server
2) Sign in with an account
3) Sign out with an account
4) Delete server account
#### Communication
5) Show all contacts and their status
6) Add a user to contacts
7) Show contact details of a user
8) 1 to 1 communication with any user/contact
9) Define presence message
10) Send/receive notifications
11) Send/receive files

Each function can be understood with respect to what it does by reading the name.

## Install and use it on your computer

Taking into account that the previously described tools are already configured (Visual Studio Code, Maven, Java, Junit) and if this is not the case, visit the download links of each one.
- https://code.visualstudio.com/download (Download relevant extensions)
- https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
- https://www.java.com/es/download/ie_manual.jsp
- https://junit.org/junit5/

You must create an empty folder where you want to have the project. You should open the terminal and do git clone to this repository. Within visual studio code open the general folder that contains src, target, pom.xml, etc. And if it is done correctly, you only need to run the project and start playing with the project. I hope this readme is helpful. Good luck!
